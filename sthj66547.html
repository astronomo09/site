        <h3>Predictions</h3>
        <p>
          The future looks bright and gentle for you as the past seems to be waning heavily on your mind. The stars will shine on you soon, removing the shade that has eclipsed your life. Watch out for upcoming bad events which might test your will, but remember that there is always light at the end of the tunnel. Eventually, happiness awaits you.

        <h3>Social Life</h3>
        <p>Outgoing and friendly, cheerful and bubbly. These are the best adjectives that can be used to describe you. You're kind and forgiving, but also harsh when it matters. Easily moved, you are bound to be hurt in the future as you might have been in the past, but the people that truly care are near and around you. Your social life will ebb and flow, choose the poeple you keep wisely.</p>

        <h3>Love Life</h3>
        <p>Always hoping to find true love but never able to. Love will always be hazy for you until you take it into your own hands. A person filled with dormant but indomitable will, you have held on to the hope that you've met or will meet your significant other soon. It still seems to be far into the future, as there are no signs you'll meet that person soon. But it doesn't seem to be set in stone, as fate might bow to your will.</p>

        <h3>Financial</h3>
        <p>A crutch to others but steel onto itself. Financially, it seems that you have already found a comfort zone. Major oppurtunities lie ahead but it is recommended to proceed with caution as most of them are likely to fail. When the time is right, you'll get a sign from the stars and only then should you take a leap of faith</p>
